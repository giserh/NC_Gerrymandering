Please note that this can not just be cloned and run.  There is data that is not commited from the US census that is needed to run this example.

The App is run from com.rhc.gerrymandering.app.GerrymanderingApp.java.  Please start there when looking through the code. 

The GerrymanderingSolution and the Block class in the domain package are the main Optaplanner classes.  

You may notice several classes and config files that mention Polygons, please ignore those, as those were just experimentations I have not gotten to work yet.  They are not used anywhere as currently configured.
